# Emmet plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

This is experimental alpha version of new Emmet plugin. Currently, plugin only expands abbreviations and doesnâ€™t contain any additional actions like [Balance](http://docs.emmet.io/actions/match-pair/) or [Update Image Size](http://docs.emmet.io/actions/update-image-size/), they will be added later.

You can either select the abbreviation or keep the cursor at the end of the abbreviation and invoke the command `Emmet 2.0: Expand Abbreviation` to expand it.
