# Emmet plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

This is experimental alpha version of new Emmet plugin. Currently, plugin only expands abbreviations and doesnâ€™t contain any additional actions like [Balance](http://docs.emmet.io/actions/match-pair/) or [Update Image Size](http://docs.emmet.io/actions/update-image-size/), they will be added later.

The expanded emmet abbreviation shows up in the auto completion list along with all suggested abbreviations.

Expansion is supported only on HTML files, support for rest will be added later.
