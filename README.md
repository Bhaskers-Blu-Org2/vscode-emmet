# Emmet plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

This is experimental alpha version of new Emmet plugin. Currently, plugin only expands abbreviations and wraps selected text with abbreviations. Additional actions like [Balance](http://docs.emmet.io/actions/match-pair/) or [Update Image Size](http://docs.emmet.io/actions/update-image-size/)  will be added later.

The expanded emmet abbreviation shows up in the auto completion list along with all suggested abbreviations.
